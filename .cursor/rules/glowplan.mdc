GlowPlan is a beauty, skincare, and wellness app designed with a soft pink aesthetic and elegant user experience.

ðŸ“š App Structure:
- SplashScreen.swift: shows app logo, loads startup
- WelcomeView.swift: user taps \"Start My Glow\"
- QuizView.swift: onboarding skincare quiz BEFORE sign up
- RoutineSummaryView.swift: shows user's personalized morning and evening routine
- AuthView.swift: signup/login screen AFTER quiz if user wants to save routine
- HomeView.swift: dashboard after signup
- RoutinesView.swift: manage saved routines
- RecommendedView.swift: product recommendations
- GlowChatView.swift: chat with GPT AI assistant, personalized with quiz results
- AccountView.swift: user settings, quiz results, logout

ðŸ›  Core Features:
- Firebase Authentication (email/password)
- Firestore Database (users, quiz results, routines)
